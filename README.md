**AI-Powered File Compression**

NeuralZip64 is a next-generation file compression tool that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance data compression efficiency. By combining deep learning techniques with traditional algorithms, NeuralZip64 optimizes file sizes while maintaining lossless decompression.

## ðŸ”¥ My Passion Behind NeuralZip64
I started this project because I saw a real need for AI-driven compression software. After searching extensively, I found that nothing like this currently existed. With very little coding knowledge, I took the initiative to create this as an **open-source project**, hoping that others who share my passion for AI and compression technology would contribute and help bring this idea to life. 

NeuralZip64 is more than just a compression toolâ€”it's a **collaborative effort** to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve in data efficiency. If you're as excited about this as I am, I invite you to join me in making NeuralZip64 even better!
